Name: WeatherDashboard

Description: 
The page is a weather dashboard. The user can search any city and recieve the weather for that city for next five days. Type in the city of your choice and then click the magnifying glass. The city will populate below. Click on the city and the weather will then appear to the right of the page.

Here is a live link to the Weather Dashboard. https://cnperkins.github.io/WeatherDashboard/ 8/17/2020.

I've added a screenshot of the webpage in the assets folder.

Thank you for checking out my day planner!
